# Pattern
This is a simple program containing a recursive method written without using a loop that creates a pattern according to the value n received from the user.

Rule : Subtract the digit 5 from the entered number until the entered number is 0 or negative. Print the last value on the screen during each extraction process. After the number is negative or 0, add 5 again. Again, print the last value of the number on the screen for each addition operation.
